# ESP32-GIFPlayer
Dynamic GIF player for ESP32 CYD, with Google Home control and HTTP server

This code lets your ESP32 CYD display GIF images stored on the microSD card, with control via HTTP requests or Google Home (on/off functionality, like a smart lamp). Switch GIFs dynamically without reflashing firmware—just update the microSD.

✨ Bonus: you can create a simple script on your OS to trigger GIF changes based on keyboard presses or mouse movements, turning the display into an interactive companion!
